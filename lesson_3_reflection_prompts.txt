When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

A remote repository could be a useful tool for backing up files. It can 
also be useful for others to work on a project in parrellel and have only 
one central location that people are wriing changes back too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This alllows the user to have discression on which of others chnages are 
included in the you local repository. If someone made a change that 
introuced a bug or you do not want to implement a feature that someone 
added.
