When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

A remote repository could be a useful tool for backing up files. It can 
also be useful for others to work on a project in parrellel and have only 
one central location that people are wriing changes back too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This alllows the user to have discression on which of others chnages are 
included in the you local repository. If someone made a change that 
introuced a bug or you do not want to implement a feature that someone 
added.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

Forks are used when you would like to use someone elses work to start to 
complete your own project. If you like someone else's code you can fork 
to begin your own project as a starting point. Clones are used to work in 
you work in your development enviroment. You can make edits and 
troubleshoot to your likeing. Branches are used in your your project 
development to add a feature that does not affect previous code. This can 
be useful for other people to work on code or you to individaully develop 
someting.
