What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a new repository you are opening an unseen directory
where chnages can be cached and logged behind the scenes. This allows
for more flexibility when trying new code.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the repository because it allows for
multiple files being commited. This is helpful in writing code because one
small change does not ensure that only one file changed. This way you can
commit mulitple files at once.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

Staging area is a great tool understand a snapshot in time. This could be 
helpful if you get pulled off task. Using git diff and will be helpful 
tool in this regard.
